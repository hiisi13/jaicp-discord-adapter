# jaicp-discord-adapter
A companion repository for "Building an Unsplash bot for Discord post" on Dev.to.

This is a JAICP-Discord adapter part - you also need [a chatbot project](https://github.com/hiisi13/jaicp-discord-unsplash-bot) for the whole thing to work.

> This adapter only implements a subset of [JAICP reply types](https://help.just-ai.com/docs/en/JS_API/variables/response) - see documentation for the full list and feel free to extend.

1. Rename `.env.example` to `.env` and replace placeholders with actual credential values.
2. `npm install`
3. `node index`
